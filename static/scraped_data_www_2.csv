 Discard Return FAQs 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Question 1: I filed my Original ITR u/s 139(1) on 30th July 2023 but not yet verified. Can I Discard it? 
 Response: 
Yes, user can avail the option of “Discard” for the ITRs being filed u/s 139(1) /139(4) / 139(5) if they do 
not want to verify it. User is provided a facility to file an ITR afresh after discarding the previous  
unverified ITR. However, if the “ITR filed u/s 139(1)” is Discarded and the subsequent return is filed after  
the due date u/s 139(1), it would attract implications of belated return like 234F etc., Thus, it is advised to  
check whether the due date for filing the return u/s 139(1) is available or not before discarding any  
previously filed return. 
 Question 2: 
I Discard my ITR by-mistake. Is it possible to reverse it? Response: 
No, if ITR is Discarded once, it can’t be reversed. Please be vigilant while availing Discarding option. If an  
ITR is Discarded, it means that, such ITR is not filed at all. 
 Question 3: 
Where can I find “Discard option” ? Response: 
User can find Discard option in below path :  
www.incometax.gov.in → Login → e-File → Income Tax Return → e-Verify ITR → “Discard” 
 Question 4: 
Is it mandatory to file subsequent ITR if I “Discarded” my previous unverified ITR ? Response: 
A user, who has uploaded the return data earlier, but has made use of the facility to discard such unverified  
return is expected to file subsequent an ITR later on, as it is expected that he is liable to file the return of  
income by way of his earlier action.  
 Question 5: 
I sent my ITR V to CPC and it is in transit and not yet reached CPC. But I don’t want to verify the  
ITR as I get to know that details not reported correctly. Can I still avail “Discard” option? Response: 
User shall not discard such returns, where the ITR-V has already been sent to CPC. There is an undertaking to this effect before discarding the return.  
 Question 6: 
When can I avail this “Discard” option and can I avail this “Discard” option multiple times or only  
once? Response: 
User can avail this option only if the ITR status is “unverified” / “Pending for verification”. There is no  
restriction on availing this option multiple times. Precondition is “ITR status” is “Unverified” / “Pending for  
verification”. 
 Question 7: 
My ITR filed for AY 2022-23 is pending for verification. Can I avail this “Discard” option? Response: 
User can avail this option only from AY 2023-24 onwards for the respective ITR. This option will be  
available only till time limit specified for filing ITR u/s 139(1)/139(4) /139(5) (i.e., 31st December of  
respective AY as of now). 
 Question 8: 
I discarded my Original ITR 1 filed on 30th July 2023 on 21st August 2023 and I want to file subsequent  
ITR on 22nd August 2023. Which section should I select? Response: 
If user discards the Original ITR filed u/s 139(1) for which due date u/s 139(1) is over, they are required to  
select 139(4) while filing subsequent return. As there is no prior valid return exist, date of Original ITR /  
Acknowledgement number if Original ITR fields are not applicable. Further, if user wants to file revised return  
in future, he needs to provide details of “Original filing date” and “Acknowledgement number” of the valid ITR  
i.e., ITR filed on 22nd August 2023 for filing revised ITR
